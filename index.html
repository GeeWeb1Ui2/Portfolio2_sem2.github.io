        <h2>Interactive fiction game</h2>
        <p>Intro<br>
          We were shown examples of interactive fiction games. In these games you can select different choices. Based on the choices you take the stories that come up change.<br>
          
          Plot picked<br>
          I picked a short story by O. Henry called "The gift of the Magi". It is a Christmas story about a poor couple who want to buy each other Christmas gifts for each other. They end up selling their most prized possesions to buy each other gifts.
          
          To read the full 6 page story go to this link or read it in the PDF document on the right:
          <a href="https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf" style="color: blue;">The gift of the Magi</a><br>
          Story i made<br>
          In the original story there is much limited choices compared to the game that i made. I created many different options that can be picked by the person. To play the game go to this link:

    <h2>Capturing diversities of KR Market</h2>
    <p>
    Intro<br>
We visited KR Market. It is a market that sells a wide variety of items and goods. They are well known for their flower market, but they also sell house hold items, food items, kitchen ware, daily items, etc. It is the first place is Bangalore to be lit with a light bulb.<br>
Brief on work done<br>
I had to talk to a vendor and collect information to make into any form: either digital or on paper. I spent a good amount of time to look for someone who speaks English. I finally found someone and collected a good amount of information from him. <br>
I decided to make a illustration of him infront of his shop. I put that as the cover page. After that i put in a interview with the shopkeeper.<br>
Fictional vendor: We also had to make up a fictional vendors life story and create some content on him.<br>
I created a 16 page booklet which included a short story on market, history of KR Market, the interview with the shop keeper and the fictional vendor.<br>

      We visited BLR Fort and had a team project. We had to collect information, pictures and other content. We then had to make different contents from what we collected to be presented at the college for exhibition.<br>
      Brief on work done<br>
      I was doing a documentation presentation for the first week. After the first few days i got bored with that because it was too simple and i wasnt doing much work. <br>
      So i started doing some illustrations. When i showed the faculty she suggested doing 3 illustration of the fort from different views and naming it "Gates of BLR Fort- A Walkthrough".<br>
      Final work<br>
      I created a documentation presentation with help from some other team members. I also created 3 illustrations of the fort. <br>

    <h2>The lifestyle of diverse people</h2>
    <p>Intro<BR>
      We visited Raitasante, a market area. We were instructed to talk with different vendors there and try to understand them. <br>
      We faced some issues. Most of the vendors were not interested in helping because they didn't see how they would benefit by helping us. Also there was a language barrier as only a few of us knew Kannada.<br>
      We collected as much info, pictures and drawings as we could.<br>
      Brief on work done<br>
      We then showed our faculty all the work collected. He said that we have to make any content after the end of the course. We could make printed books, pictures, stories or anything we wanted. He also let us collect information from other people as well, because many of us had not collected much information.<br>
      Final work<br>
      I used the information collected to make a case study of diverse people from across the world. <br>
      Then i made a website and app wireframe. It will help you find what your skills are and which field of study will suite you. Much like a personality test.<br>

    <h2>Wireframe for helping a movie character</h2>
    <p>Intro<br>
      We were told to think of a character from a movie that wants to solve a problem. <br>
      We then had to think of a way to solve his problem using a interface.<br>
      I choose Nick Fury from Avengers. He wants to build a superhero team. He wants to get heroes quickly.<br>
      Brief on interface design<br>
      My website helps people build superhero teams. You can search through a list of popular superheros, all heros or post a job and the applicants. <br>
      If you want to know their powers you can see their list of powers and skills or watch a demo video which demonstrates their powers. <br>
      After you have made your choice you can then assemble the team and fight villains.<br>
      Target Audience<br>
      This interface is generally aimed at superheros and/or people who want to build superhero teams. <br>
      It is in place to assemble world class alliances to defeat enemies. This is a public interface and anyone can log in and view the content available.<br>

    <h2>Find a solution to a problem</h2>
    <p>Intro<br>
      We were told to look for a badly designed website. We had to create a website wireframe for the existing website. <br>
      We then had to think of ways to improve it and make changes to make it easier and better.<br>
      Website picked<br>
      I picked a website called lingscar.com. It is car leasing and has a range of cheap cars for leasing and contract hire options for business or personal use. This website is for people who want to rent a car for a short period from a month to around 3 years.<br>
      Brief on problems with original website<br>
      The original website (LINGsCARS.com) had too much animation, pictures. It was not a professional website for car leasing. The home page was long and would take up lot of effort from the user to navigate up and down to the navigation bar. The cars list on the left side does not have to include the name of all the models that are available. The website could just display the logo of all cars. If the user is interested in a particular car brand he could click on the logo and it would take him to the list of the models of that car brand. The car lease agreement need not be there at the bottom page. It can be displayed when you are going to buy the car.<br>
      Brief on improvements done<br>
      My website is better than the original website because it reduces the animation and pictures to a minimum required amount. My home page is much smaller than the original and it is much easier for the user to navigate by using the navigation bar. I reduced the car brands list to just their names. If anyone is interested then they can click on the logo of the required brand and see all the available models of that brand. There is an about page if you want to know more about the owner. The car lease will be displayed on the page previous to the final payment.<br>
      I completely changed the page from the original. I added a select city button at the top left of the page where you can go and select the city. I also added a offers and deals bar at the top right of the page. I also added 3 steps to get the lease offer. I removed a lot of unnecessary text, pics, animation and the blank space.<br>
      This wireframe will satisfy the user more than the original one as you can get the lease offer in 5 clicks<br>
      1. Select city<br>
      2. Select brand<br>
      3. Select model<br>
      4. Select loan/lease and fill in the details<br>
      5. Click get lease offer and fill in the details to get lease offers.<br>
      The changes i made will make it much easier and faster for users to get the lease offers. The wireframe is also much easier to navigate than the original.<br>
